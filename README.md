Select Stream Field Type (PyroCMS)
===============================

## Installation
Create a folder called "select_stream" inside of `addons/default/field_types` or `shared_addons/field_types`. Download `field.select_stream.php` and put it inside that folder.

## Usage
You can use it as a field inside Pages or Streams. You can get the value (which is the stream slug) by referencing the variable with Lex: `{{ var }}`.
